\title{recurmulti: A package for estimating Recurrent Multinomial Models}
\description{
The recurmulti package provides functions to fit and evaluated recurrent
multinomial models
}
\details{
Note that the parameter labels in this package differ from those in the
paper.
The package uses eta, beta, and zeta for coefficients, corresponding to
X, Z, and Q covariate matrices. Eta contains the baseline
probability coefficients, analogous to traditional multinomial
regression coefficients. Beta contains recurrence coefficients for sequence
position-specific covariates, while zeta contains recurrence coefficients
for position-independent covariates. This provides memory and performance
improvements.

Future versions will harmonize the naming of coefficients with the paper.
